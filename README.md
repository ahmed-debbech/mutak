# Mutak : Music Tracker for Spotify
### What is this?
Mutak is a desktop app and an Open Source project based on QT framework. \
Have you ever loved song during its play on a specefic playlist but you just missed its name after a while because you didn't press the heart button? \
So i came up with this solution for Spotify which provides a full & detailed history for each track/song
you listened to marked by date and time.
### How's this possible?
Mutak actually retrives data of an alredy-logged in user from Spotify databases and stores them in the local machine of the user under txt files. In this way you can acceess any song you played it whenever it was.
