**Visit official website: [mutak.site](https://bit.ly/2WUHah8)**
### What is this?
Mutak is a Windows desktop app and an Open Source project based on QT framework. \
Have you ever loved song during its play on a specific playlist but you just missed its name after a while because you didn't press the heart button? \
I came up with this solution for Spotify which provides a full & detailed history for each track/song
you listened to marked by date and time.
### We promise this: 
##### ->Simple
All features in only one window, navigate in the stored history through clanedar.
##### ->Beautiful
We used the same Spotify colors and designed evey element to look cute.
##### ->Rare
As far as we know there are a VEEEEERY few services/products (third-party apps) that provide this feature which is missing from Spotify itslef.
### How's this possible?
Mutak actually retrives 50 tracks each time it refreshes of an alredy-logged in user from Spotify databases and stores them in the local storage of the machine under `.mu` files. In this way you can acceess any song you played whenever it was. 
**Pro Tip: if you leave Mutak working during the whole day in background you will never miss a song because it will retrive new tracks from the servers each 15min.**
### How can i install this on my machine?
Mutak binary is provided by an installer for Windows.
1) visit [mutak.site](https://bit.ly/2WUHah8) and Download the latest version.
2) execute the installer.exe (if a window pops up that says "Windows protected your PC " click "Run anyway").
3) After launching the installer follow the instructions by clicking next
4) The installer will ask you to install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ click install (this is a critic part of the system and must be installed). if already installed click close.
5) After installing launch Mutak and enjoy!
### How to use Mutak in a nutshell?
* Log in to your Spotify account through your browser and after launching Mutak click Login and it will automatically recognize your account.
* Refresh the Track list each time to retrive newest tracks.
**Keep in mind that tracks that appear on the list are played at in the day of the current system date and there is no redundant tracks; if you listen to a song more than once a day it will be listed one time which is the time you first played it that day.**
* Navigate through the grey buttons to an early specific day to see the tracks of that day.
* Use the calendar button to make the navigation through days simpler and clearer.
